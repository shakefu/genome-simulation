Things to do.

[X] Write a _fast_ set class for mutations.
[X] Finish modifications to Chromosome class to
    accomodate above.
[X] Implement fitness formula for selection.
[X] Figure out offspring behaviour.
[X] Fam allele frequency
[X] average & variance of fitness (FAM & non-fam)
[X] average & variance of fitness of long/short - distance dispersal
[X] check real short distance uniform (2)
[ ] cost for distance dispersal option
[X] option for allele dominance (1 bad = 1/20th or so)
[ ] FAM relative fitness/small radius (1-2)
[X] check open-space based movement (EverybodyReproduce)
[ ] fixed probably of long-distance dispersal (FAM dependence on fitness)

// idea
have all surviving adults pair off & produce offspring
select offspring until # of openings or so survive
randomly fill openings until all are filled or no moves left
